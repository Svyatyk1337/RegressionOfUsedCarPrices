Regression of Used Car Prices - EDA for Visualization Practice

This project focuses on performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) for the "Regression of Used Car Prices" competition dataset. The goal is to practice data visualization techniques and gain insights into the factors influencing used car prices.
Project Overview

In this project, I used the dataset from the "Regression of Used Car Prices" competition to analyze the relationships between various features of used cars and their prices. The main objective was to apply different visualizations and EDA techniques to understand the data better and explore the distribution of prices, the impact of features, and any possible correlations.
Key Highlights

    Data cleaning and preprocessing: Handling missing values and outliers.
    Visualizations: Various plots (scatter plots, bar charts, heatmaps, etc.) to understand the relationship between features and the target variable (price).
    Feature analysis: Exploring continuous and categorical features, including car make, model, age, mileage, and more.
    Insights: Understanding the distribution of car prices, identifying significant trends, and preparing the dataset for future modeling tasks.

Tools Used

    Python
    Pandas
    Matplotlib
    Seaborn
    Jupyter Notebooks

Dataset

The dataset contains information on used cars, such as car make, model, year, mileage, and price. The goal is to predict the price of a used car based on these features.
Future Work

In the future, I plan to apply machine learning models to predict car prices using the features explored in this EDA.
